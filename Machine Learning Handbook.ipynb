    "1. Supervised learning- In supervised learning the training data you feed to the algorithm includes the desired solutions, called labels\n",
    "\n",
    "    ex.The spam filter is a good example of this: it is trained with many example emails along with their class (spam or ham), and it must learn how to classify new emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ex. Another typical task is to predict a target numeric value, such as the price of a car, given a set of features (mileage, age, brand, etc.) called predictors . This sort of task is called regression  \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Here are some of the most important unsupervised learning algorithms\n",
    "Clustering \n",
    "1. k-Means \n",
    "2. Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) Embedding (t-SNE)\n",
    "3. Expectation Maximization\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualization and dimensionality reduction\n",
    "1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) \n",

    "2. Eclat\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet another important unsupervised task is anomaly detection —for example, detecting unusual credit card transactions to prevent fraud,\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, another common unsupervised task is association rule learning , in which the goal is to dig into large amounts of data and discover interesting relations between attributes. For example, suppose you own a supermarket. Running an association rule on your sales logs may reveal that people who purchase barbecue sauce and potato chips also tend to buy steak. Thus, you may want to place these items close to each other."
